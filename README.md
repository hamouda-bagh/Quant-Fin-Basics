# Quant-Fin-Basics
My personal work on the numerical projects of a book called **"A First Course in Stochastic Calculus"**.

The book is newly published by Louis-Pierre Arguin, an assoicate professor of mathematics at Brauch College & Graduate Center CUNY. It covers the basics of the stochastic calculus used in the Quantitative Finance domain, form Brownian Motion to Itô calculus.

The general objective of the book is to present the theory of Itô calculus based on Brownian motion and Gaussian processes. In particular, the goal is to construct stochastic processes using the Itô integral and to study their properties. The last chapter presents the applications of the theory to option pricing in finance.

Here you will find my personal codes written for each chapter in a separate file.
